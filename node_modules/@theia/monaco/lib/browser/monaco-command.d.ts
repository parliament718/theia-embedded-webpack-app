     * Register commands from Monaco to Theia registry.
     *
     * Monaco has different kind of commands which should be handled differently by Theia.
     *
     * ### Editor Actions
     *
     * They should be registered with a label to be visible in the quick command palette.
     *
     * Such actions should be enabled only if the current editor is available and
     * it supports such action in the current context.
     *
     * ### Editor Commands
     *
     * Such actions should be enabled only if the current editor is available.
     *
     * `actions.find` and `editor.action.startFindReplaceAction` are registered as handlers for `find` and `replace`.
     * If handlers are not enabled then the core should prevent the default browser behavior.
     * Other Theia extensions can register alternative implementations using custom enablement.
     *
     * ### Global Commands
     *
     * These commands are not necessary dependent on the current editor and enabled always.
     * But they depend on services which are global in VS Code, but bound to the editor in Monaco,
     * i.e. `ICodeEditorService` or `IContextKeyService`. We should take care of providing Theia implementations for such services.
     *
     * #### Global Native or Editor Commands
     *
     * Namely: `undo`, `redo` and `editor.action.selectAll`. They depend on `ICodeEditorService`.
     * They will try to delegate to the current editor and if it is not available delegate to the browser.
     * They are registered as handlers for corresponding core commands always.
     * Other Theia extensions can provide alternative implementations by introducing a dependency to `@theia/monaco` extension.
     *
     * #### Global Language Commands
     *
     * Like `_executeCodeActionProvider`, they depend on `ICodeEditorService` and `ITextModelService`.
     *
     * #### Global Context Commands
     *
     * It is `setContext`. It depends on `IContextKeyService`.
     *
     * #### Global Editor Commands
     *
     * Like `openReferenceToSide` and `openReference`, they depend on `IListService`.
     * We treat all commands which don't match any other category of global commands as global editor commands
     * and execute them using the instantiation service of the current editor.
